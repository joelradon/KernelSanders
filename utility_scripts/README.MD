# Overview

These scripts facilitate the preparation and management of source code files, allowing users to easily gather and format their code for AI interactions with KernelSanders. By excluding certain files and ensuring only relevant file types are processed, they optimize the userâ€™s experience when interacting with the AI bot.

Both scripts are designed to:
- List all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- Print the contents of each file, excluding README.md.
- Copy the output to the clipboard for easy pasting.

Create a source code text file and upload it to Telegram. It will be stored for 4 hours and linked directly to your username. After that, it will be deleted.

**REMEMBER TO NEVER PUT SENSITIVE CODE ANYWHERE.** While this bot has a private store for each user and deletes each file after 4 hours, practice safe coding and don't put any sensitive information in your code base.
