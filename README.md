## Overview

KernelSanders is a Telegram bot that empowers developers by facilitating interactions with their source code files. Whether you're seeking intelligent code suggestions, need to manage your code snippets, or require context-aware responses from an AI assistant, KernelSanders has you covered. The bot ensures that your data is securely stored and automatically managed, providing a seamless and efficient coding companion.

## Features

- **Intelligent Responses:** Utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 model to receive context-aware and intelligent responses to your queries.
- **Source Code Management:** Upload `.txt` source code files that the bot can reference to provide more accurate assistance.
- **Persistent Storage:** All responses and uploaded files are securely stored in AWS S3 with automatic expiration after 4 hours.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of messages a user can send within a specific timeframe.
- **Web Response Links:** Generate short-lived web links for your responses, enhancing readability and navigation.
- **Group Chat Support:** Tailored functionalities for both individual and group chats, ensuring privacy and efficiency.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run KernelSanders on your local machine or server.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Go:** [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.16 or higher recommended).
- **AWS Account:** Access to an AWS account with permissions to create and manage S3 buckets.
- **Telegram Bot Token:** Obtain a bot token by creating a new bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
- **AWS S3 Bucket:** Create an S3 bucket to store user data and responses.
- **Secret Manager (Recommended):** For securely managing environment variables and secrets.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joelradon/KernelSanders.git
   cd KernelSanders
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure all necessary Go packages are installed.

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Configuration

KernelSanders relies on several environment variables for configuration. It's highly recommended to use a secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to store these variables securely.

#### Required Environment Variables

- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token obtained from BotFather.
- `OPENAI_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
- `OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: (Optional) Custom OpenAI API endpoint. Defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.
- `BOT_USERNAME`: The username of your Telegram bot (without `@`).
- `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`: The endpoint URL for your AWS S3 service.
- `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located.
- `BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your AWS S3 bucket.
- `PORT`: (Optional) The port on which the server will run. Defaults to `8080`.
- `BASE_URL`: (Optional) The base URL for generating response and file links. Defaults to `http://localhost:8080`.
- `NO_LIMIT_USERS`: (Optional) Comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs exempt from rate limiting.

#### Setting Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in your shell or use a `.env` file with a secret manager. Here's an example using a `.env` file:

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
BOT_USERNAME=KernelSandersBot
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://s3.your-region.amazonaws.com
AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
PORT=8080
BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NO_LIMIT_USERS=123456789,987654321
```

> **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or any sensitive information to version control. Always use secret managers or environment variable configurations provided by your deployment platform.

### Running the Bot

1. **Build the Application:**

   ```bash
   go build -o kernelsanders cmd/main.go
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   ./kernelsanders
   ```

   The server will start on the specified port (default `8080`). Ensure that this port is accessible and properly configured in your Telegram bot webhook settings.

3. **Set Telegram Webhook:**

   To receive updates from Telegram, set your bot's webhook to point to your server's URL.

   ```bash
   curl -F "url=https://your-domain.com/" https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN>/setWebhook
   ```

   Replace `https://your-domain.com/` with your actual server URL and `<YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN>` with your bot token.

### Uploading Source Code

KernelSanders allows you to upload your source code files to provide context for more accurate and relevant responses.

**Supported File Type:** Only `.txt` files are accepted to ensure security and simplicity.

**Uploading in Private Chats:**

1. Open a private chat with the KernelSanders bot.
2. Click on the attachment icon (üìé).
3. Select and send your `.txt` source code file directly.

**Uploading in Group Chats:**

1. In a group chat, attach your `.txt` source code file.
2. In the caption, tag the bot using `@KernelSandersBot` to ensure it processes the upload.

**Note:** Uploaded files are stored for **4 hours**. Uploading a new file will overwrite the existing one and reset the storage time.

### Interacting with the Bot

You can ask KernelSanders various questions related to your application, get code suggestions, or request explanations. The bot uses the uploaded source code to provide context-aware responses.

**Example Interaction:**

1. **User:** "How can I optimize my sorting algorithm?"
2. **KernelSanders:** Provides suggestions based on the uploaded source code.

**Short-Lived Web Responses:**

For better readability and navigation, KernelSanders generates web links for your responses. These links are temporary and will expire after the specified duration.

**Example:**

```
Here is your optimized sorting algorithm: [View Formatted Response](https://your-domain.com/abc123-def456-ghi789)
```

## Security Best Practices

KernelSanders prioritizes the security and privacy of your data. Here are the best practices implemented and recommended for users:

1. **Secure Storage:**
   - All uploaded files and responses are stored in AWS S3 with strict access controls.
   - Files are automatically deleted after 4 hours to minimize data exposure.

2. **Environment Variables Management:**
   - **Recommendation:** Use a secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to store environment variables and sensitive information like API keys and tokens.
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets or committing them to version control systems.

3. **File Validation:**
   - Only `.txt` files are accepted to prevent potential security risks associated with executable or binary files.
   - Ensures that uploaded content is plain text, reducing the risk of code injection or malware.

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage among users.
   - Exemptions are available for trusted users to maintain flexibility.

5. **Logging and Auditing:**
   - All interactions are logged and stored securely for auditing purposes.
   - Helps in monitoring usage patterns and identifying potential security threats.

6. **Open-Source Transparency:**
   - The project's source code is open for community review, fostering transparency and collaborative security enhancements.

7. **User Data Privacy:**
   - Personal data and uploaded files are handled with utmost confidentiality.
   - Encourages users not to upload sensitive information despite the secure handling mechanisms.

**Additional Recommendations for Users:**

- **Avoid Uploading Sensitive Information:** While the bot manages data securely, always refrain from uploading sensitive or confidential code.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies and packages are up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
- **Monitor Access Logs:** Regularly review access logs for any unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts.
